# 4-DoF-Robotic-Arm

Spur gears required for the transmission mechanism were fabricated & meshed together. The base was made to clamp the waist servo1 
A 4 DoF Robotic Arm was assembled, electrical circuits were connected. While some of the mechanical structures required for the body of the bot were 3D printed, some others were fabricated in the Central Workshop (both by the courtesy of BITS-Pilani, Hyderabad Campus).

This repository contains:
1) code
2) Final structure of the arm
3) Design of the 3d printed parts
